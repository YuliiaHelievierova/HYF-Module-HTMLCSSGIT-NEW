1) To make that folder or file hidden, add a dot (.) at the beginning of the name:
$ mkdir .week1
$ touch .command
2) Use the -p option with the mkdir command. The -p option makes sure that parent directories are created as well if necessary:
$ mkdir -p hack/your/future
3) When you echo a piece of text, the echo command will automatically add a newline:
a) $ echo Hack; echo Your; echo Future
b) $ (echo Hack; echo Your; echo Future)
